# Plants-Pathology-Image-Classification-Project
Identifying the category of Foliar diseases in apple trees using Computer Vision algorithms and deployed using Flask

# 1. Bussiness Problem

## 1.1 Problem Description
The misdiagnosis of the many diseases impacts agricultural crops and can lead to misuse of chemicals leading to the emergence of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, so computer-vision based model can help to efficiently classify these diseases.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
The dataset is taken from "Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7" Kaggle competition. In this competition, the challenge is to distinguish between leaves which are healthy, leaves which are infected with apple rust, leaves that have apple scab, and leaves with more than one disease.

## 1.3 Business Objective
1. Build a model which gives maximum accuracy.
2. The model should have Strict Latency Constraint.
